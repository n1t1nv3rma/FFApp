<p>Hi there! </p>
  
<p> We are simply part of a <b>non-profitable charity</b> organisation, who believes in humanity and believes that <b> God is One </b>.</p>

<p> Our aim is simply to connect Hunger with Food! There are hundreds and thousands of food charity organisations in Australia where needy people can find free food and get rid of their hunger. But unfortunately it is not known to many people suffering from hunger and disabilities. So this is just one of our initiatives to make it easier and have one-stop to search all such places. </p>

<p> If you would like to share similar information or are running such Food Charities which are not listed in this App, <b>please</b> do let us know by contacting us at info@hermanfoundation.com </p>

<p> May The Supreme God Bless Humanity! </p>
